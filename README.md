### Abstract
This notebook outlines how the KC2 working group common metadata model, identifer services, and content negotiation enable interoperability on data objects between commons participants. In phase 2 we plan to extend this capability to all digital objects in the commons.

Specifically, we show how two identifier types (DOIs and Minids/ARKs) minted by three commons teams (Helium, Sodium, and Argon) can be used interchangably. We show that given either identifier type we can resolve, interpret the metadata, and then download the data irrespective of the identifier type or stack on which the identifier was minted.

We then show how new identifiers can be minted and registered using the Argon Identifiers service and the Sodium ORS service.
